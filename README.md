# Phase 4 Full-Stack Application
## User Stories

Welcome to your one stop shop to learn the beautiful language of Croatia!

We've built an app that will help you learn the basic foundations of the Croatian language through immersive vocabulary testing as well as some general/ basic grammar and syntax.

As a user you will be able to:
- log in using login credentials - the password be will be encrypted on the backend
- browse and flip through vocab index cards on the main page
- self report if the words were understood or not
- filter back to the words that you were not able to remember so that you can get extra review
- save vocab words for isolated practice later
- there will at least 3 modules that will be implemented
- the app will track the user's progression through the modules
